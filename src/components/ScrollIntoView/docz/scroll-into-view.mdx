## Description
ScrollIntoView does exactly what you think it would do. You can pass it a trace prop and it will retrigger the scrollIntoView function anytime the traceProp changes.

## Usage
<Playground>
  <div style={{ marginTop: "70vh"}}>
    <ScrollIntoView>
      <div style={{backgroundColor: "lime"}}>Hello, I just scrolled into view!</div>
    </ScrollIntoView>
  </div>
</Playground>
